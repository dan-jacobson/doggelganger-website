TL;DR: We never store your pictures or selifes. 

If you "share" your doggelganger with a friend, we note that, and give the AI a gold star, but we still never store your picture.

We never store pictures themselves. We throw them away as soon as we have a match. We do store when you "share" a match.

We also store basic stuff about the app: how often it crashes, what parts people click on, how many folks actually open the Petfinder link, etc.

Want to see more about the details? See [our full privacy page](privacy) with more details, though still written in plain english.
